# Nanalysis-Challenges

These are my answers to "Email survey questions for Developers" for Nanalysis.

To run Swift playground files either:
1. Open in XCode, if you're on OSX
2. Use http://online.swiftplayground.run/ to copy and paste the programs into and run.

For the questions "Embedded Hardware Protocol" (in English) and the "Non-Technical Questions" there are PDF copies of my answers
in this repository.
