# Nanalysis-Challenges

These are my answers to "Email survey questions for Developers" for Nanalysis.
PDF answers and Swift playgrounds are all in the Nanalysis folder.

To run playground files either:
1. (On OSX) Open playground in XCode
2. (On PC/Linux) Navigate inside the playground folder and view Contents.swift for each playground project.
   Use http://online.swiftplayground.run/ to copy and paste the Contents.swift code and run.

For the questions "Embedded Hardware Protocol" (in English) and the "Non-Technical Questions" there are PDF copies of my answers.

** Nanalysis has given me permission to keep this on a public repository
